    "description": "The Nittaku has produced a mere 200 of this Limited Edition 2023 blade. The ETO blade was produced in Japan using premium quality Kiso Hinoki wood and modern carbon technologies. The carbon layers are situated between Kiso Hinoki outer layers and the core ply and are produced from the revolutionary elastic rubber carbon which improves the playing properties of the blade. It was a challenge for the production to make the handle, not from wood, but from carbon material. The carbon in the handle is very light which reduces the total weight of the blade to approximately 75 gr. The size of the bade is 157 mm x 150 mm. Made in Japan."

    "description": "This is the Japanese Pen version of the Darker Imperial Hinoki 2020. It is quite exceptional. It is a single ply, made of the best quality Kiso Hinoki wood. Every single component and step of the development is excruciatingly carefully selected and controlled, making it one of the most exclusive blades on the market. Japanese Kiso Hinoki wood is so rare that we can only hope that Darker will continue to have access to the high-quality Hinoki wood from that area for many more years to come because once they run out, it will be another 250 years until the newer Hinoki trees will be aged enough to be once again used in the making of these beautifully crafted blades. Let's just say that the price is warranted. Any lines on the blade are characteristic of Hinoki wood. They are neither cracks nor signs of glueing/bonding. These are single-ply blades, made of pure HINOKI and each surface is very unique. Darker never glues pieces of Hinoki together but uses glue only to attach the grip pieces to the blade. Hinoki is a very fragile material. Very weak under the strong impact. Even with the rubbers, if you place the blade too roughly on the table it could possibly crack. That is why many Japanese users always carry spare blades, just in case. Handle with care. Resin is one of the characteristics of HINOKI wood. It may come out over time. It does not affect the function of the blade."
